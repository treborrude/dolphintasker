DolphinTasker

This project is both a Dolphin add-on and a Tasker plugin.
It will not work without both Dolphin and Tasker installed.

This plug-in is intended to expose Dolphin events (such as
"page load completed") to Tasker. Eventually, the plugin should
also be capable of controlling Dolphin (in whatever ways are exposed
to the add-on API) from Tasker.

Even at this early stage, I'm already using Tasker 4.2+ extensions
to the plug-in API, so this plugin will not work in Locale. I may
eventually try to acheive compatibility, but I've never used Locale,
so it's going to be quite low on my priority list.

This is my first major Android development project, so expect me to
break convention out of ignorance. When you catch me doing something
that could be done in a more standard way, feel free to enlighten me.

I have finally received my Dolphin API key, so developent is underway
again. However, I'm still inexperienced and don't have a great deal of
time to dedicate to this project, so development will still be slow.

This project only supports building in AIDE on Android at the moment.
Commits to support building in Eclipse / ADT or Android Studio would
be welcome, as long as they don't interfere with building in AIDE.
