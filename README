DolphinTasker

This project is both a Dolphin add-on and a Tasker plugin.
It will not work without both Dolphin and Tasker installed.

This plug-in is intended to expose Dolphin events (such as
"page load completed") to Tasker. Eventually, the plugin should
also be capable of controlling Dolphin (in whatever ways are exposed
to the add-on API) from Tasker.

This is my first major Android development project, so expect me to
break convention out of ignorance. When you catch me doing something
that could be done in a more standard way, feel free to enlighten me.
